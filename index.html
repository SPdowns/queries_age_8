    <div class="column">
      <p>Media queries allow us to make our sites <em>responsive</em>.  We can use media queries to apply CSS styling only when certain conditions apply. For instance, our sites can look different depending on the size of the screen, or <em>viewpoint</em> a user is viewing our content with. We can also change the way our site appears if a user is printing our website, or using a screen-reader!
